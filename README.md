fuel-mailchimp
==============
Overview
=============================================
We needed mailchimp for twittstrap.com, so i have decided to create this fuel package and share it on github.
The project will be based on a PHP 5.2+ API client for [v2 of the MailChimp API](http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/api/2.0/).
